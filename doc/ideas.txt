Keyboard
-- delay on typing and typing patterns
-- IRC, Slack; is there a key stroke protocol;
-- hook into a public IRC channel that is pumping data... could we determine bots Vs humans?
-- Grab a key logging framework, and build off of that? HTML/JS for collection, .js html plugin
-- Typing Errors, deletes; rate of failure; correlation between rate of failure and speed.
-- Type of keyboards, keyboard layouts make a difference (if we note what type of computer are people are on).
-- Languages, second languages; could gleam some more information into usage
-- Main Goal: Determine Unique Users; and how many keystrokes does it take?
